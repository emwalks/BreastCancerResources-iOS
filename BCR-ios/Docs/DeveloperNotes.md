## Concurrency

- Currently having a parsing error. Get request returns JSON from remote resource - the error is a parsing error. 
- Refactor back to having the resource not contain an id remotely?
- Use what I've learned in https://github.com/emwalks/CodingChallengePractice/tree/main/CodingChallengePractice and apply here (concurreny)
